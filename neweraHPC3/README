NeweraHPC(high perfomance cluster) is an open source  library with 
advanced network communication modules designed for carrying out 
mathematical calculations on a wide range of computers.

The program is designed to distribute calculations on a grid so as to decrease execution time.

GOAL:
The goal behind the program is to create a universally acceptable platform 
for super computing which can be put to use on various work areas.
Most importantly we chose to develop on GCC as it is available on 
various platforms. We could run our program on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and BSD. 
We are looking for active participation from developers to work with us as there 
are tremendous opportunities available in this area.
