NeweraHPC is a High Performance Cluster designed to work exclusively on TCP/IP protocol layer with extensible plug-in support. Unlike other grid platforms we have a standard library including base functions and a small client program which is to distribute tasks to node.

This is a very new project and I look forward for your support to make it work even better.

Clusters have become powerful and so have the interconnects. Building applications that can inherently be on the network and take the advantage of network can be of real use. This project has a neweraHPC3 code branch in the subversion repository. This is the main code repository, containing a primitive scheduler and the networking infrastructure. There are various dimensions to this project.
